# Training-Avalanche-Rescue-Dogs
Itâ€™s time for your charity to train a new generation of dogs in how to find hikers swept up by avalanches. There's debate in the office as to which dogs are best; is a large dog better than a smaller dog? Should the dogs be trained when they're young or when they're more mature? Thankfully, you have statistics on rescues performed over the last few years that you can look to. Training dogs is expensive, though, and you need to be sure that your dog-picking criteria are sound.
